# room-booking-webapp

A project that is part of my [Claude Code exploration](https://github.com/geoffweatherall/room-booking).

## Details

A single-page web application for the [room-booking-api](https://github.com/geoffweatherall/room-booking-api) GraphQL API. It lets users view and add persons, rooms, and bookings. The app is a static build hosted on AWS (S3 + CloudFront) and talks directly to the AppSync GraphQL endpoint from the browser.

This checkout expects the `room-booking-api` project to be a **sibling directory** — the deploy script reads the API's URL and Cognito settings from its Terraform outputs.

Users must **sign in** (or sign up) with an email address and password before they can see any page other than the home page; see [Authentication](#authentication). Signing up also collects the user's name, which the API uses to automatically create a linked Person record once the account is confirmed (see the [room-booking-api README](https://github.com/geoffweatherall/room-booking-api#sign-up-creates-a-linked-person)) — so a new user doesn't need the "Add Person" page just to book something as themselves.

## Directory structure

| Path | Purpose |
|---|---|
| [webapp/](webapp/) | The React application (Vite + TypeScript). All frontend source, tests, and build config live here. |
| [webapp/src/pages/](webapp/src/pages/) | One component per route — the list pages (`PersonsPage`, `RoomsPage`, `BookingsPage`), the add-forms (`AddPersonPage`, `AddRoomPage`, `AddBookingPage`), the auth forms (`SignInPage`, `SignUpPage`, `ForgotPasswordPage`), and `HomePage`. This is where page-level logic lives. |
| [webapp/src/auth/](webapp/src/auth/) | Everything Cognito: the promise wrappers around `amazon-cognito-identity-js` ([cognito.ts](webapp/src/auth/cognito.ts)), the React auth context/hook ([authContext.ts](webapp/src/auth/authContext.ts)), and its provider ([AuthProvider.tsx](webapp/src/auth/AuthProvider.tsx)). |
| [webapp/src/components/](webapp/src/components/) | Shared presentational components used across pages: `Layout` (app bar + nav + sign-in/out), `RequireAuth` (route guard), `ErrorBanner`, `SuccessToast`, `SubmitButton`. |
| [webapp/src/graphql/](webapp/src/graphql/) | Everything about talking to the API: query/mutation documents, TypeScript types mirroring the schema, error-code → message maps, and date formatting. |
| [webapp/src/hooks/](webapp/src/hooks/) | Shared hooks; currently `useLocationToast`, which shows a one-shot success toast after navigation. |
| [webapp/tests/](webapp/tests/) | Playwright end-to-end tests. |
| [deploy/terraform/](deploy/terraform/) | Terraform for the hosting infrastructure: S3 bucket ([s3.tf](deploy/terraform/s3.tf)) and CloudFront distribution ([cloudfront.tf](deploy/terraform/cloudfront.tf)). All resource names are prefixed with `<environment>-<project_name>` ([locals.tf](deploy/terraform/locals.tf)) so multiple environments can coexist in one AWS account. State is stored remotely in S3, one state file per environment ([backend.hcl](deploy/terraform/backend.hcl) — see the [room-booking-bootstrap-terraform](https://github.com/geoffweatherall/room-booking-bootstrap-terraform) README for how that bucket is set up, and the [room-booking project README](https://github.com/geoffweatherall/room-booking#multi-environment-deployments) for the multi-environment design). |
| [deploy.sh](deploy.sh) / [undeploy.sh](undeploy.sh) | Deploy and tear down (see below). |

The `src/` layout follows the conventional React "group by file type" pattern (pages / components / hooks / api-layer) described in the [React FAQ on file structure](https://legacy.reactjs.org/docs/faq-structure.html#grouping-by-file-type), on top of a standard [Vite React scaffold](https://vite.dev/guide/).

## Architecture

- **React 19** with **TypeScript**, built by **Vite**. Strict-mode SPA, no server-side rendering — everything runs in the browser.
- **MUI (Material UI) v9** provides the design language: `CssBaseline` and standard components — `AppBar` navigation, `Paper`-wrapped forms and tables, `Alert`/`Snackbar` for feedback. **MUI X Date Pickers** (with **dayjs**) provide the booking time pickers.
- **Branding**: the theme's palette is built from the [room-booking project's brand tokens](https://github.com/geoffweatherall/room-booking/tree/main/branding) ([theme/tokens.ts](webapp/src/theme/tokens.ts), [theme/theme.ts](webapp/src/theme/theme.ts)), with a light/dark toggle in the app bar ([theme/ThemeModeProvider.tsx](webapp/src/theme/ThemeModeProvider.tsx)) that defaults to the OS's `prefers-color-scheme` and otherwise remembers an explicit choice in `localStorage`. The brand mark (`assets/logo.svg`) appears in the app bar next to the app name, and its `icon.svg` variant is the favicon.
- **React Router v7** does client-side routing. Routes are declared in [App.tsx](webapp/src/App.tsx): `/`, `/signin`, `/signup` and `/forgot-password` are public; `/persons`, `/persons/add`, `/rooms`, `/rooms/add`, `/bookings` and `/bookings/add` are wrapped in the `RequireAuth` guard; unknown paths redirect to `/`.
- **amazon-cognito-identity-js** talks to the Cognito user pool (SRP sign-in, sign-up, token storage/refresh in `localStorage`).
- **Apollo Client v4** handles all GraphQL communication and caching (`InMemoryCache`).
- **oxlint** for linting, **Playwright** for end-to-end tests.

### Main classes / where the logic is

There is deliberately little logic in the frontend; the backend owns the rules.

- [apolloClient.ts](webapp/src/apolloClient.ts) — the single Apollo client instance: an `HttpLink` to the endpoint behind a `SetContextLink` that attaches the signed-in user's JWT to every request.
- Page components in [src/pages/](webapp/src/pages/) hold the form state and submit handlers. [AddBookingPage.tsx](webapp/src/pages/AddBookingPage.tsx) is the most involved: it loads rooms and people for its dropdowns, defaults the start time to the next 5-minute boundary, and maps validation error codes to messages.
- [graphql/types.ts](webapp/src/graphql/types.ts) — TypeScript mirrors of the schema types plus the `ROOM_ERROR_MESSAGES` / `BOOKING_ERROR_MESSAGES` maps that translate backend error enums into user-facing text.
- [graphql/errorMessages.ts](webapp/src/graphql/errorMessages.ts) — flattens Apollo transport/GraphQL errors into displayable strings.
- [graphql/formatDateTime.ts](webapp/src/graphql/formatDateTime.ts) — renders the API's zone-less local date-times without letting the browser reinterpret them in its own time zone.

## Calling the API

The browser calls the AppSync GraphQL endpoint directly via Apollo Client. Every request carries the signed-in user's Cognito **JWT id token** in the `Authorization` header (attached by the `SetContextLink` in [apolloClient.ts](webapp/src/apolloClient.ts)); AppSync rejects requests without a valid token with HTTP 401. The endpoint URL and Cognito ids are baked into the bundle at build time from the Vite environment variables `VITE_GRAPHQL_API_URL`, `VITE_COGNITO_USER_POOL_ID` and `VITE_COGNITO_CLIENT_ID` (see [.env.example](webapp/.env.example)); `deploy.sh` generates `webapp/.env.production` from the deployed API's Terraform outputs. These values are public identifiers, not secrets — the security lives in Cognito's password authentication and JWT signatures.

### Authentication

Authentication is an **Amazon Cognito user pool** owned by the API project (see the [API README](../room-booking-api/README.md)); this app uses the pool's public `room-booking-webapp` app client via `amazon-cognito-identity-js`.

- **Sign up** ([SignUpPage](webapp/src/pages/SignUpPage.tsx)) is two steps: register a name, email + password (at least 8 characters with upper/lower case, a number and a symbol), then enter the verification code Cognito emails. The name is sent to Cognito as the standard `name` user attribute. On confirmation the user is signed in automatically, and the API's PostConfirmation trigger creates a Person record for them in the background.
- **Sign in** ([SignInPage](webapp/src/pages/SignInPage.tsx)) authenticates with SRP (the password never leaves the browser in plain form). Tokens are cached in `localStorage` and refreshed transparently, so sessions survive page reloads.
- **Signed-in display name** ([AuthProvider](webapp/src/auth/AuthProvider.tsx)): the toolbar shows the caller's own `Person.name` (fetched via the API's `myPerson` query, which resolves it server-side from the JWT's `sub` claim), not the JWT's own `name` claim — the Person record is the single source of truth a future "change my name" feature would update, so reading it live avoids the two ever drifting apart. Falls back to the Cognito `name`/email attributes (read straight from the ID token, no round trip) until that query resolves, and permanently for accounts with no linked Person (e.g. the e2e test user).
- **Forgot password** ([ForgotPasswordPage](webapp/src/pages/ForgotPasswordPage.tsx), linked from the sign-in form) is two steps: request a verification code for an email address, then enter the emailed code with a new password. On success the user is signed in with the new password automatically. Cognito's *prevent user existence errors* setting is enabled, so requesting a code for an unknown address behaves exactly like a real one — the form never reveals whether an account exists.
- **Route guarding**: only the home page and the two auth forms are public. [RequireAuth](webapp/src/components/RequireAuth.tsx) redirects signed-out visitors of any other route to `/signin`, remembering where they were heading and returning them there after sign-in.
- **App bar**: shows the signed-in user's email and a Sign out button (or a Sign in link). Signing out clears the Cognito session and the Apollo cache.
- The auth state (current user's email + sign-in/out functions) is provided by [AuthProvider](webapp/src/auth/AuthProvider.tsx) and read with the `useAuth()` hook; the promise-based Cognito wrappers live in [cognito.ts](webapp/src/auth/cognito.ts).

### Error handling

Two kinds of errors reach the user, both rendered by the dismissible [ErrorBanner](webapp/src/components/ErrorBanner.tsx) (an MUI `Alert`) at the top of the page:

1. **Transport/GraphQL errors** (network failure, missing/expired token, server fault) surface through Apollo's `error` result and are flattened to messages by `errorMessages()`.
2. **Validation failures** are *not* GraphQL errors — the API returns a structured result (`CreateRoomResult` / `CreateBookingResult`) whose `errors` field lists broken-rule enum codes. The form pages map each code through `ROOM_ERROR_MESSAGES` / `BOOKING_ERROR_MESSAGES` to a human-readable message, so a rejected submission shows the complete list of problems in one banner.

On success, forms navigate to the relevant list page and pass a message via router state; `useLocationToast` shows it as an auto-hiding `Snackbar` and clears the state so it doesn't reappear on refresh.

### Progress indicators

- List pages show a centred `CircularProgress` on first load, and a slim `LinearProgress` above the table when refetching with cached data already on screen (`cache-and-network` fetch policy).
- [SubmitButton](webapp/src/components/SubmitButton.tsx) disables itself and shows an inline spinner while a mutation is in flight (Cancel is disabled too), preventing double submits.
- The booking form shows a spinner while loading the room/people reference data its dropdowns need.

### Validation: client vs server

All rules are **enforced server-side** by the API's Lambda handlers (see the [API README](../room-booking-api/README.md)); the frontend re-states none of them and simply displays whatever errors come back. Client-side, the UI only *prevents* invalid input where it can do so cheaply: the booking time pickers offer only 5-minute-boundary minutes, room/organiser/attendees are chosen from dropdowns of existing records, and the capacity field is numeric. Anything that slips through (e.g. an overlapping booking, or a blank room name) is caught by the server and shown in the banner.

## Hosting

The production build is a set of static files served from a **private S3 bucket** behind a **CloudFront distribution**:

- The bucket blocks all public access; CloudFront reads it via an Origin Access Control, so the bucket is only reachable through the CDN.
- CloudFront redirects HTTP→HTTPS, uses the default CloudFront certificate/domain, and `PriceClass_100` (cheapest edge locations).
- S3 403/404 responses are rewritten to `/index.html` with a 200 status so deep links to client-side routes (e.g. `/bookings/add`) load the SPA instead of erroring.

Like the API, hosting scales to zero: S3 storage pennies plus per-request CloudFront charges, no fixed-cost resources.

## Build, run, deploy

Prerequisites: Node.js + npm, Terraform ≥ 1.10, AWS credentials, and a deployed `room-booking-api` in the sibling directory.

Like the API, `deploy.sh`/`undeploy.sh` take an **environment** name (e.g.
`test`, `production`, or your own name) and talk to the `room-booking-api`
deployment of that same environment — see the [room-booking project README](https://github.com/geoffweatherall/room-booking#multi-environment-deployments)
for the full multi-environment how-to.

### Local development

```bash
cd webapp
cp .env.example .env        # then fill in real values: source the API project's
                            # authenticate.sh <environment> and copy GRAPHQL_API_URL,
                            # COGNITO_USER_POOL_ID and COGNITO_WEBAPP_CLIENT_ID
                            # into the three VITE_ variables.
npm install
npm run dev                 # Vite dev server on http://localhost:5173
npm run lint                # oxlint
npm run build               # type-check (tsc -b) + production build into dist/
```

### Deploy / undeploy

`./deploy.sh <environment>` performs, in order:

1. Sources the API project's `authenticate.sh <environment>` to obtain `GRAPHQL_API_URL` and the `COGNITO_*` variables from that environment's Terraform outputs (fails fast if the API checkout or that environment's deployment is missing).
2. `terraform init` (state key `<environment>/room-booking-webapp/terraform.tfstate`) + `terraform apply -auto-approve -var="environment=<environment>"` in [deploy/terraform](deploy/terraform) to create/update the S3 bucket and CloudFront distribution.
3. Writes `webapp/.env.production` with the API URL, Cognito user pool id, and webapp client id.
4. `npm install` and `npm run build` to produce `webapp/dist/`.
5. `aws s3 sync webapp/dist s3://<bucket> --delete` to upload the build and remove stale files.
6. Creates a CloudFront invalidation for `/*` so the new version is served immediately, then prints the site URL.

`./undeploy.sh <environment>` runs `terraform destroy` (with interactive confirmation) — it deletes that environment's distribution and bucket including all uploaded assets.

## Tests

**End-to-end (Playwright):**

```bash
source ../room-booking-api/authenticate.sh test   # exports E2E_USER_EMAIL / E2E_USER_PASSWORD
cd webapp
npm run test:e2e
```

Playwright starts the Vite dev server on port 5173 automatically (or reuses one already running) and drives Chrome. Because most pages now require sign-in, the suite has a **setup project** ([tests/auth.setup.ts](webapp/tests/auth.setup.ts)) that signs in through the real form as the pre-confirmed test user the API project's Terraform creates (`E2E_USER_EMAIL` / `E2E_USER_PASSWORD`, exported by its `authenticate.sh`) and saves the browser session; the main test project starts from that session.

These browser tests use a real user, while the API project's acceptance tests use machine-to-machine (client_credentials) tokens — the API README's *Authentication in end-to-end tests* section explains both approaches and why each was chosen.

- [tests/auth.spec.ts](webapp/tests/auth.spec.ts) runs signed-out (it discards the saved session) and covers the auth rules: the home page is public, every other route redirects to `/signin`, sign-in returns you to the page you were heading to, sign-out locks the app again, and a wrong password shows an error.
- [tests/forgot-password.spec.ts](webapp/tests/forgot-password.spec.ts) also runs signed-out and covers the reset flow: the sign-in form links to it, requesting a code advances to the code + new-password step, and a wrong code is rejected. It deliberately uses an email with no account — thanks to *prevent user existence errors* the flow behaves identically to a real user's, so the test sends no email and can't hit per-user reset rate limits (the code-entry step with a *correct* code can't be automated without an inbox).
- [tests/booking-form.spec.ts](webapp/tests/booking-form.spec.ts) covers the Add Booking form's time pickers — asserting that only 5-minute-boundary minutes are offered, matching the API's booking rule.

Note the dev server needs a valid `webapp/.env` since the pages under test talk to the live API and user pool.

**Unit tests: there are none.** The frontend contains little logic beyond wiring (the rules live in the API, which has its own unit and acceptance tests), so coverage here is Playwright-only. If frontend logic grows (e.g. date maths beyond `nextFiveMinuteBoundary`), adding Vitest would be the natural next step.
